# Four-Way Traffic Simulation with State Chart
This project simulates vehicles moving from a source to a destination through multiple four-way intersections on one-way streets. The main objective is to optimize traffic light management to minimize vehicle travel time.

## Features
- Simulates vehicle movement through one-way streets with multiple four-way intersections.
- Uses state charts to control traffic light timings.
- Aims to reduce overall travel time by optimizing traffic light sequences.
